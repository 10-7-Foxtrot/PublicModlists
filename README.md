# PublicModlists
Modlists for the 10-7 Foxtrot Arma 3 Gaming Group

## Installation
Instructions are for the client-side mod list but can be followed for any published preset in this repository.

1. Download `10-7 Foxtrot Client-Side.html`
2. Import the preset
    * From the Arma 3 Launcher, click **MODS** to go to the mods menu
    * Click **PRESET** in the upper-right corner to enter the preset menu
    * Click **Import** at the bottom of the preset menu to open a file browser
    * Browse to the downloaded `10-7 Foxtrot Client-Side.html` file and click **open**
4. (Optional) Subscribe to [dependency loaders](#dependency-loaders) for any public servers or operations you wish to participate in


## Usage
The simplest way to use our modsets is via the dependency loader.  By using this method, you only need to maintain your client-side mod list.  Mods that are required for a specific server or operation will then be loaded on top of your client-sides by the dependency loader

### Modifying your client-side mod preset
> [!CAUTION]
> `ACE Vehicle Medical`, `BackpackOnChest - Redux`, and `Enhanced Movement` all add gameplay functionality that's pretty darn important.  If you need them and don't have them you're gonna look like an asshole and get roasted on comms

1. Select your client-side mod preset via the preset menu in the launcher
2. Uncheck any mods you wish to remove
3. Go into the preset menu and click **Save** or **Save As** (An orange asterisk will indicate unsaved changes)

> [!TIP]
> Rather than repeating this process as approved client-side mods are added/removed, you can use the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG) to keep track of changes over time and only add in the client-side mods you wish to use.
 
### Using the dependency loader
1. Select your client-side mod preset in the mods menu of the Arma 3 launcher
2. Enter `10-7` into the search bar of the mods menu
3. Select the dependency loader for the server or operation you'll be joining
    * When prompted to load dependencies, select **Load selected mods**
